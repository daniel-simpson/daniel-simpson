# Hi, I'm Dan 👋

## About me

- 🔭 I’m currently working at Kolmeo in Hawthorn, VIC, Australia as their very first Developer Experience Lead
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a whole bunch about running Kubernetes (in non-production, thankfully)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on development tooling, especially around .NET and microservices
- 🤔 Unfortunately I don't use Github at my day job (💔 Bitbucket)

## My favourites

- 💙 Favourite backend language is still good old [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
- 💛 Favourite frontend project is [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- 🧡 Favourite IaC language is [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (but there's some great alternatives now)
- 💜 Favourite development tool is [meta](https://github.com/mateodelnorte/meta)
- 💚 CI/CD tooling is anything that you can run locally (before you break the build!)
- 🤎 Microservices tooling project is [Project Tye](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/)
